title: My Chosen Word for 2020

## Backstory: What is Choose One Word?
- [Choose One Word](https://learn.cleverness.com/word/vposj) is a self-guided annual ritual taught by the Dr. Jason Fox. Dr. Fox is a metamodern wizard on a quest to create a world more curious and kind (with a PhD in motivational sciences.) The premise of the program is simple--choose one word that will guide behaviors, decisions, and goals for the year (or however long you wish.)
- Unlike most goal-setting programs, the witty Dr. Fox recommends against choosing certain types of words like happiness! Success! Etc., This is because it frees oneself from judging against what seems to be an objective metric at first glance, but is more-often-than-not an arbitrary one. (What is happiness? Success?) My word last year, which I had chosen before learning about the program, was "mastery." It served its purpose in that I spent the year honing 5 areas of my life (for which I will provide a retrospective) but there was a Sisyphean facet to the word that made it less useful.
- Instead, active, aspect, or archetypal words are preferred because they carry less of an inherent measuring-stick quality. In short, **the chosen word is a beacon of light that guides along pathways to future relevance.**

## Why does Dr. Fox recommend [heralding](https://www.drjasonfox.com/blog/herald-your-word) one's word on a page like this?
In his words,

> "In a nutshell: cultivated dissonance.  

> The Ritual of Becoming is an act of manifesting*—of ‘telling the truth  in advance’, so that you might live into it, make believe, and become it.

>> Rational friends: don’t be dissuaded by my employment of magical realism. I have not descended into irrationality—merely sidestepped into para-rationality. Join in the programme and you’ll see. Sound reasonableness cloaked in glamour, ‘pon my Word.

> Thus, after deep work in Reflecting, Introspecting and Projecting (RIP)* upon ‘who you are’ and ‘who you might be’—and after finding the most exquisite and apt Word to serve you in the next chapter of your unfurling story—you then must pave the way for Actualisation. This is the phase in which you begin to adopt and an integrate new Principles, Patterns and Projects in actuality.  

>> Yes, this is like an elegy for your past self—so that parts of you might die and rest in peace, so that new elements of ‘selfness’ might emerge.  

> Your ‘/word page’ helps you do this. It’s a living space for you to enshrine the insights from your Quest to find a Word for the year."

So without further ado...

# 2020 is The Year of The Hearth for me.

For me, the word "hearth" evokes:
- Warmth, illumination, and comfort
- Stability from its ancient etymology
- A place of gathering and community

### Principles
If the chosen word is the North Star, then principles are the surrounding constellations. 
1. **Safety**: An invocation bring myself more financial, physical, and emotional safety, so I can offer it to others.
2. **Space**: An invitation to honor my capacity in building community, yet ensuring personal space for regenerating energy. Be a hearth, not a furnace:

>*“When I run after what I think I want,
my days are a furnace of stress and anxiety;
If I sit in my own place of patience,
What I need flows to me, and without pain."
Shams-i Tabrizi*

3. **Substantiate**: An incantation to create works of substance instead of subsuming works of others.

### Patterns
Dr. Fox recommended that behavioral patterns should be doable when motivation is waning.
1. **Be curious**: Use my natural novelty-seeking behavior to overcome show-stoppers and distractors.
2. **Be companionable**: Encourage oneself to reach out to others even when it feels awkward to do so.
3. **Be cumulative**: A little bit of work done is ok. Pile it up. Avoid the urge to delete.

### Projects
In a counter-intuitive fashion, Dr. Fox advised against well-defined projects, but instead offer directionality and aspirations.
1. Channel the energy of Andrew Yang in my vocational pursuits: if anything, I'm going to have the most fun!
2. Continue to build micro-communities through meditation, listening, and helping others connect.
3. Put up more writing online: treat this website as my fridge door, not my *magnum opus*.

### Enclothed Cognition
Dr. Fox encouraged giving ourselves symbolic reminders of our chosen word.
- **Phone wallpaper**: since I stare at my glowing rectangle too much anyway, might as well make it really glow:

- **Bic mini lighter**: A portable flame (also useful for camping trips)

- **Website logo**: Hopefully you have noticed by now :)

# How you can help
My overt impeding pattern is perfectionism (which Dr. Fox calls "the prettiest of the self-sabotages.") I possess dragon hoards of unshared notes and half-written essays. You can help by prodding me to share a bit more of myself on this website, or co-creating something with me.

# What is your chosen word?
- I hope this page led to inquisitiveness about a word of your own. (Or bafflement--a pre-requisite to investigation!) 
- If you are interested, here is an [affiliate link](https://learn.cleverness.com/word/vposj) to the Choose One Word program. AUD$50.00 will go toward [charities](https://cleverness.com/appeal) for the Australian bushfires, and I will receive AUD$50.00 along with an *enchanted* wizard enamel pin. 
- The program is flexible and self-directed, and can take anywhere from 3 mins/3 hours/3 weeks/3 months/as long as you want. Just the chapter on "hidden commitments" is well worth the price alone. If concepts such as "infinite games," "seminal invocations," and "why personal branding is yucky" are intriguing, then Dr. Fox is a fine companion for exploring a ritual of becoming.
